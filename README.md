A simple game where you choose a character, whether defender 
or attacker.
Both throw dice but the program calculates the probability of 
your character wining before, and warns you.
Rules:
Defender wins if he has a bigger number than, or equal number 
as the of the attacker one.
Attacker wins if he has a bigger number than the of the 
defender.
